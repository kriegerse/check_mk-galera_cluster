title: MySQL Galera Replication Health
agents: linux
catalog: app/mysql
license: GPL
inventory:
  The check yields for each running MySQL instance parsing the mysql section of
  check_mk_agent output. It will return "mysql" in case only one instance is running.
  This is the same behavior as for the standard MySQL checks delivered with
  check_mk.
description:
  This check follows the guide for Galera Cluster Monitoring
  (https://galeracluster.com/library/documentation/monitoring-cluster.html#check-replication-health).
  The check will provide performance data for Recv/Send Queues which gives hints about a replication throttling.
  For the send/recv queue average a threshold can be defined, when the check should alert for the same.
  A threhsold for the FlowControlPaused can be configured. Nodes often pauses will fall behind the
  cluster and can give a hint for tuning the slave threads.
  Additionally performance data for Cert deps distance (representing the nodeâ€™s potential degree for parallelization)
  and Flow Control Recv/Send are measured.
