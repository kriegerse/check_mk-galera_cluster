title: MySQL Galera Node State
agents: linux
catalog: app/mysql

inventory:
  The check yields for each running MySQL instance parsing the mysql section of 
  check_mk_agent output. It will return "mysql" in case only one instance is running.
  This is the same behavior as for the standard MySQL checks delivered with
  check_mk.
description:
  This check follows the guide for Galera Cluster Monitoring
  (http://galeracluster.com/documentation-webpages/monitoringthecluster.html#checking-the-node-status)
  It will show information about the readyness of the Node and if the Node is connected with any other
  Cluster Node. For both thersholds can be defined, which are by default "ON" and indicates a healthy 
  node.
  Additonally the Node state is monitored and a threshold can be set when it should throw an alert.
  This is "Initialized" by default which indicates a none operational node in the cluster.
